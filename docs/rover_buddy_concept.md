# RoverBuddy (AURUS V2) — AI Pet Companion & Assistant
> **A lively, expressive desktop companion powered by Raspberry Pi 4B, Mecanum wheels, Computer Vision, and the Gemini API.**

---

## 1. Product Overview

**RoverBuddy** transforms a standard 4-wheel robot car into a living, responsive desktop pet. Instead of moving in simple linear paths, it uses **Mecanum wheels** to slide sideways, tilt, and express excitement, curiosity, or caution. 

With the massive **V2 Upgrade**, RoverBuddy now boasts a proactive relationship engine, an SQLite long-term memory system, real-time facial and object recognition, and an Explainable AI (XAI) dashboard to understand its thought process.

## 2. Hardware Architecture

### Omnidirectional Mecanum Drive
Unlike standard wheels, Mecanum wheels have rollers angled at 45° around their circumference. By turning wheels in specific directions, the forces combine to slide the robot in any vector:

| Movement | Front-Left (FL) | Front-Right (FR) | Rear-Left (RL) | Rear-Right (RR) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Forward** | ⇧ Forward | ⇧ Forward | ⇧ Forward | ⇧ Forward |
| **Backward** | ⇩ Backward | ⇩ Backward | ⇩ Backward | ⇩ Backward |
| **Strafe Left** | ⇩ Backward | ⇧ Forward | ⇧ Forward | ⇩ Backward |
| **Strafe Right** | ⇧ Forward | ⇩ Backward | ⇩ Backward | ⇧ Forward |
| **Spin Left** | ⇩ Backward | ⇧ Forward | ⇩ Backward | ⇧ Forward |
| **Spin Right** | ⇧ Forward | ⇩ Backward | ⇧ Forward | ⇩ Backward |

## 3. The Emotional & Proactive Engine

RoverBuddy keeps track of internal mood variables (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`) in a background process, ensuring it acts like a living creature rather than a passive assistant:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Idle State] -->|Human Enters Room| B(Greeting Initiative)
    A -->|Human Ignores Rover| C(Check-In Initiative)
    A -->|Left Alone for hours| D(Sleepy/Social Energy Recharges)
    E[Sensor Triggers] -->|Obstacle < 15cm| F(Scared & Hardware Override)
    G[User Interaction] -->|Voice commands / treats| H(Happy & Relationship++)
```

### Mood Metrics
1.  **Happiness (Joy):** Increased by feeding treats or speaking to it. Decays slowly.
2.  **Curiosity (Alertness):** Increased by sensor activity (seeing objects move past).
3.  **Social Energy:** Depleted by interaction, recharged when alone. Prevents the bot from being overly annoying.
4.  **Relationship Strength:** Grows over days of positive interactions, logged in the database.

## 4. AI-Coordinated Interaction & Vision

RoverBuddy uses the **Google Gemini API** combined with local **MediaPipe** vision to generate responses. 

### Computer Vision
The robot continuously scans its environment:
- **Presence Tracking:** Determines if a human is in the room ("Present" vs "Absent") to trigger greetings or sleep states.
- **Follow Mode:** Computes X/Y bounding boxes to calculate the precise angle needed to pivot the robot, while using Sonar ping distance to approach and maintain a 40cm gap from the human.

### Example Exchange & XAI

*   **User says:** *"Hey Rover, follow me!"*
*   **System Action:**
    1.  The **Intent Router** detects the regex `follow me`.
    2.  The API is bypassed, and the state switches to `mode_follow`.
    3.  The **Follow Loop** takes over the motors.
    4.  The **Explainable AI (XAI)** dashboard flashes:
        *   `Decision: Action: FOLLOW_START`
        *   `Reason: Follow Intent Detected`
        *   `Confidence: 98%`
        *   `Source Data: User: follow me!`

## 5. Web Interface Layout

The interface offers a responsive, glassmorphic dark-mode control center:
